# Hello Cylera Team ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking the time to look over my submission for the take home assignment.

A couple things to note:

* The vector downloads from Sympli were `.pdf` for some reason. Instead of spending the time to find alternatives or using a `.png`, I've just stubbed in some very plain svg's into the components.
* The fonts from the design were not available publicly. I've subsituted them with a couple free alternatives.
* I started work on the two cards containing graphs, but unfortunately didn't find enough time finish the 'Top 5 Missions' and so I left that section commented out of my code. The Payloads card is located at `components/pages/dashboard/PayloadsByNationality`.
